# Transition into Tech

This repository contains the finished example code for six examples of feaures those taking part should achieve during the jQuery portion of the programme, as well as a finished example website based on the Chubb the Pug template.

The tasks cover the following topics:

* Example 1 - Click event tracking
* Example 2 - Hide/Show elements
* Example 3 - Fade/Slide animations
* Example 4 - Simple Custom animation
* Example 5 - Add/Remove CSS classes
* Example 6 - jQuery AJAX to fetch data from a file

Once reviewed those taking part should try to use these examples as references to apply what they have learned to their own website they have been working on during day 1 & day 2.

The finishedWeb folder contains an example of using these techniques on a web page based on the Chubb the Pug template.

## Advanced

For those who already have a background in these technologies and want to advance further here are some ideas to try to implement, mentors will be on hand to advise and help:

* Connect to a live API, like a weather API and show that data on your webpage
* Implement a Facebook like/share button on your webpage
* Implement an integrated Twitter timeline
* Run your website on your own local server
* Checkout jQuery UI to add additional functionality to your website
* Use the HTML Canvas and JavaScript to create your own snake game on your website
