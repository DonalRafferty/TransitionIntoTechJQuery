# Transition into Tech

This repository contains the finished example code for the six tasks those taking part should achieve during the jQuery portion of the programme, as well as a finished example website based on the Chubb the Pug template.

The tasks cover the following topics:

* Task 1 - Click event tracking
* Task 2 - Hide/Show elements
* Task 3 - Fade/Slide animations
* Task 4 - Simple Custom animation
* Task 5 - Add/Remove CSS classes
* Task 6 - jQuery AJAX to fetch data from a file

Once completed those taking part should try to apply what they have learned to their own website they have been working on during day 1 & day 2.

The finishedWeb folder contains an example of using these techniques on a web page based on the Chubb the Pug template.

## Advanced

For those who already have a background in these technologies and want to advance further here are some ideas to try to implement, mentors will be on hand to advise and help:

* Connect to a live API, like a weather API and show that data on your webpage
* Implement a Facebook like/share button on your webpage
* Implement an integrated Twitter timeline
* Run your website on your own local server
* Checkout jQuery UI to add additional functionality to your website
* Use the HTML Canvas and JavaScript to create your own snake game on your website
